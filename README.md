## üìñ What I learned from this course..?
  - How to reach the Optimal solution from the naive one.
  - How to divide any big problem into smaller sub-problems related to the original(including the Base case, which is the core       of any solution).
  - How to build Logical steps interconnected with each other to solve the problem.
